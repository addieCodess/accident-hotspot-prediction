# 🚦 Accident Hotspot Prediction for Safer Roads

A Machine Learning project by **Team Hexora 🌸**  
*Built to predict accident-prone locations and improve road safety.*

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Road accidents are a leading cause of death and injury worldwide. Many occur repeatedly at specific **hotspots** due to factors like poor infrastructure, road conditions, traffic density, or weather. Traditional safety measures are **reactive**, only applied after multiple accidents.

Our project aims to develop a **machine learning–based system** that proactively predicts accident hotspots so authorities can:
- Allocate resources effectively
- Improve road safety infrastructure
- Save lives by preventing accidents before they happen
